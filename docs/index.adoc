== Introduction

=== Data directory property sources

Routes and other relevant configuration properties are loaded from geOrchestra "data directory"'s
`default.properties` and `gateway/gateway.yaml`.

The location of the data directory is picked up from the `georchestra.datadir` environment property,
and the additional property sources by means of spring-boot's 
`spring.config.import` environment property, like in:
`spring.config.import: ${georchestra.datadir}/default.properties,${georchestra.datadir}/gateway/gateway.yaml`.
